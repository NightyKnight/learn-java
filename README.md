filesystem and IntelliJ will handle creating the project and all the setup stuff needed for Maven. You can  verify that
everything worked by opening the `App.java` file in the `src/main/java/education/` directory and clicking  the green 
arrow to the left of the `main` method and selecting the `Run App.main()` option. If all goes well you should see the 
output of the program in the `Run` window within IntelliJ.
